# hire-me-pls — project context for Claude Code

## What this repo is

A Claude Code plugin (`v1.3.0`) implementing a diagnosis-first job search system. Eight skills cover the full pipeline: discover → diagnose → tailor → cover → interview prep → story bank. Installable via `claude plugin install`.

Plugin manifest: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Marketplace definition: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

## Repo layout

```
.claude-plugin/         plugin manifest + marketplace
skills/                 8 skill folders (each has SKILL.md + references/ + scripts/ where needed)
  cover-letter/
  cv-tailor/            the most complex skill — docxtpl render pipeline, audit, bold helper
  interview-prep/
  job-discovery/
  job-search-pipeline/  the orchestrator; owns the skill router and shortcut DSL
  job-search-setup/     first-run wizard
  role-diagnosis/
  story-bank/
shared/                 example YAMLs (committed), scripts (text_to_docx.py), conventions.md
templates/              .docx template sets (OPUS is the primary; others are stubs)
tests/                  pytest suite — test_autoescape.py, test_bold_runs.py (5 tests)
config/                 gitignored — config.yaml, branches.yaml, regional-headers.yaml, connectors.yaml
assets/                 gitignored — career.md, voice/, Blacklist.txt, story bank, session notes, index.txt
job-log/                gitignored — Job Listings.xlsx and Backup/
applications/           gitignored — dated [session-date]/[Country]/ session output (paths.session_output_dir)
interview-prep/         gitignored — interview prep documents
.scratch/               gitignored — ad-hoc helper scripts, content-map dumps, temp files
settings.json           plugin-level permissions (python *, pip *)
requirements.txt        docxtpl, python-docx, docxcompose, openpyxl, PyYAML, pytest
```

## Key design rules

**Path conventions**
- Cross-skill references inside `skills/` use relative paths: `../sibling-skill/references/foo.md`
- References to `shared/` or `templates/` from inside skills use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/...`
- Workspace paths (config, assets, job log, session output, interview prep) are driven by `config.yaml > paths` block — skills read from the block, not hardcoded strings
- Config YAML files live in `config/` (gitignored); `shared/*.example.yaml` are the committed templates

**cv-tailor render pipeline** (non-negotiable rules, hard-won from past failures)
- `autoescape=True` is mandatory on every `tpl.render()` call — omitting it silently strips ampersands
- Call `convert_content_map(cm)` (in `skills/cv-tailor/scripts/md_to_richtext.py`) immediately before render — converts `**phrase**` markers to docxtpl RichText bold runs
- `run_full_audit()` (in `skills/cv-tailor/scripts/audit.py`) runs after every render; a failed audit means the CV is not shipped
- The template file must not be open in Word when rendering — docxtpl will silently write a corrupt file

**Skill router** (lives in `skills/job-search-pipeline/SKILL.md`)
- `job-search-pipeline` is the single entry point for multi-step tasks and all `Run [...]` shortcut commands
- `role-diagnosis` is a hard gate before `cv-tailor` — no Diagnosis.md means no CV (except `Run CV only`)
- Opinionation mode defaults to `warn-once-then-comply`; `opinionation: strict` in config.yaml makes gates hard refuses

**`~~` placeholder convention**
- Tool-agnostic public plugin: third-party product names in body text are wrapped as `~~job board (Indeed)`, `~~web scraper (Apify)` etc.
- `CONNECTORS.md` at repo root documents the full placeholder system
- Never apply `~~` to SKILL.md frontmatter `name` or `description` fields, YAML keys, or Python strings

## Testing

```
python -m pytest tests/ -v          # must be green before any PR
claude plugin validate .             # must pass with no warnings
```

`tests/conftest.py` adds `skills/cv-tailor/scripts` to `sys.path`.

## Workspace layout (gitignored)

All paths are configurable via `config.yaml > paths`. Defaults:

```
config/                             config.yaml, branches.yaml, regional-headers.yaml, connectors.yaml
assets/                             career.md, voice/, Blacklist.txt, Interview Story Bank.txt, Session Notes.txt, index.txt
job-log/                            Job Listings.xlsx and Backup/
applications/[session-date]/[Country]/   per-day, per-geography session output (paths.session_output_dir)
  Diagnosis - [Company] - [Title].md
  CV - [Company] - [Title].docx
  Cover Letter - [Company] - [Title].docx
  LinkedIn Messages.txt
interview-prep/                     interview prep documents
.scratch/                           ad-hoc helper scripts, content-map dumps, temp files
```

`[session-date]` is today's date formatted per `paths.session_date_format` (default `dd.mm.yy`, e.g. `11.06.26`; `mm.dd.yy` for US-style dates).

## Branch / PR workflow

Main branch is `main`. Feature work goes on named branches, PR to `main`. CI runs on push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): SKILL.md frontmatter lint, pytest.
