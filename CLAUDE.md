# hire-me-pls — project context for Claude Code

## What this repo is

A Claude Code plugin (`v1.7.0`) implementing a diagnosis-first job search system. Eight skills cover the full pipeline: discover → diagnose → tailor → cover → interview prep → story bank. Installable via `claude plugin install`.

Plugin manifest: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Marketplace definition: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

## Key design rules

**Path conventions**
- Cross-skill references inside `skills/` use relative paths: `../sibling-skill/references/foo.md`
- References to `shared/` or `templates/` from inside skills use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/...`
- Workspace paths (config, assets, job log, session output, interview prep) are driven by `config.yaml > paths` block — skills read from the block, not hardcoded strings
- Config YAML files live in `config/` (gitignored); `shared/*.example.yaml` are the committed templates

**cv-tailor render pipeline** (non-negotiable rules, hard-won from past failures)
- The scripts only *render* a pre-built `content_map`; the model *authors* every bullet/section into it from the diagnosis. Samey or un-tailored CVs are a spec problem in `role-diagnosis` + `cv-tailor` SKILL text (the diagnosis's "Section angles" block), not a bug in `render_cv.py`.
- `autoescape=True` is mandatory on every `tpl.render()` call — omitting it silently strips ampersands
- Call `convert_content_map(cm)` (in `skills/cv-tailor/scripts/md_to_richtext.py`) immediately before render — converts `**phrase**` markers to docxtpl RichText bold runs
- `run_full_audit()` (in `skills/cv-tailor/scripts/audit.py`) runs after every render; a failed audit means the CV is not shipped
- The template file must not be open in Word when rendering — docxtpl will silently write a corrupt file
- Inspecting a rendered CV: `python-docx`'s `paragraph.text` returns **empty** for `**bold**`/`labeled` bullets (they render as docxtpl `RichText` runs it doesn't parse). Read raw `word/document.xml` `<w:t>` nodes instead — the bullets are there. (`audit.py`'s `_visible_text` / `_bullet_text` already do this.) Empty `.text` is NOT proof of a render failure.
- To test an authoring/spec change end-to-end, re-render in `.scratch/` against the **repo's** scripts (`sys.path` → `skills/cv-tailor/scripts`) and `templates/OPUS/full_template.docx`, then read bullet text from raw XML — don't trust the cached installed plugin or `python-docx .text`.

**Skill router** (lives in `skills/job-search-pipeline/SKILL.md`)
- `job-search-pipeline` is the single entry point for multi-step tasks and all `Run [...]` shortcut commands
- `role-diagnosis` is a hard gate before `cv-tailor` — no Diagnosis.md means no CV (except `Run CV only`)
- Opinionation mode defaults to `warn-once-then-comply`; `opinionation: strict` in config.yaml makes gates hard refuses

**`~~` placeholder convention**
- Tool-agnostic public plugin: third-party product names in body text are wrapped as `~~job board (Indeed)`, `~~web scraper (Apify)` etc.
- `CONNECTORS.md` at repo root documents the full placeholder system
- Never apply `~~` to SKILL.md frontmatter `name` or `description` fields, YAML keys, or Python strings

## Testing

```
python -m pytest tests/ -v          # must be green before any PR
claude plugin validate .             # must pass with no warnings
```

`tests/conftest.py` adds `skills/cv-tailor/scripts` and `shared/scripts` to `sys.path`.

## Workspace layout (gitignored)

All paths are configurable via `config.yaml > paths`. Defaults:

```
config/                             config.yaml, branches.yaml, regional-headers.yaml, connectors.yaml
assets/                             career.md, voice/, Blacklist.txt, Interview Story Bank.txt, Session Notes.txt, index.txt
job-log/                            Job Listings.xlsx and Backup/
applications/[session-date]/[Country]/   per-day, per-geography session output (paths.session_output_dir)
  Diagnosis - [Company] - [Title].md
  CV - [Company] - [Title].docx
  Cover Letter - [Company] - [Title].docx
  LinkedIn Messages.txt
interview-prep/                     interview prep documents
.scratch/                           ad-hoc helper scripts, content-map dumps, temp files
```

`[session-date]` is today's date formatted per `paths.session_date_format` (default `dd.mm.yy`, e.g. `11.06.26`; `mm.dd.yy` for US-style dates).

## Branch / PR workflow

Main branch is `main`. Feature work goes on named branches, PR to `main`. CI runs on push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): SKILL.md frontmatter lint, pytest.

## Releases

Releases are cut by the `plugin-updater` agent (`.claude/agents/plugin-updater.md`) after feature PRs merge. The standard, in short:

- The version is bumped **in sync in three places**: `plugin.json`, the plugin entry in `marketplace.json`, and `metadata.version` in all 8 SKILL.md frontmatters. Run `python scripts/bump_version.py X.Y.Z` to sync all three at once (or `--check` to verify they agree, e.g. in CI). A CHANGELOG entry and the CLAUDE.md version line stay hand-written and ship with every bump.
- A `vX.Y.Z` git tag is created on the release commit on `main` and pushed. Update prompts for installed users fire off the `version` field in `plugin.json` (after `/plugin marketplace update sherifscript`), not the tag — the tag is the human-facing release marker.
- The plugin's install id is `hire-me-please` (renamed from `hire-me-pls` in v1.4.1 because some app UIs title-case the raw `name` and ignore `displayName`); the GitHub repo slug stays `sherifscript/hire-me-pls`. Don't rename either.
- Listing on claude.com/plugins requires submission via platform.claude.com/plugins/submit (community marketplace review); once approved, their CI tracks new commits automatically.
